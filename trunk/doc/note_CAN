ioctl calls allows us to configure a bunch of option like
 *bit rate -> CAN_IOCSRATE : do not understand yet how it works and what should be chosen
 *set a filter -> CAN_IOCSFILTER : it is the ID of the message
  I suppose that the ID can be chosen arbitrarily 
 *modify the mode -> CAN_IOCTNORMALMODE, CAN_IOCTLOOPBACKMODE, CAN_IOCTLISTENONLYMODE, CAN_IOTSLEEPMODE
  I don't know yet what it is, normal mode should be ok 


CAN on dsPIC33F registers for ECAN are at page 58, DMA at pages 56-57
 *Modes register CiCTRL1 and CiCTRL2
  -initialisation mode : allows to change the configuration of the CAN 
  -disable mode
  -normal mode
  -other modes are not usefull for us (listen only, listen all messages, loopback)
 *Baud rate configuration registers CiCFG1 and CiCFG2
 *Filter to be accepted : register CiFEN1
 *CiRXFnSID register with identifier
 *CiRXFUL1 register to control if receive buffer are full
 *CiTRmnCON : TX/RX buffers control register
 *ECAN message buffer are part of DMA RAM memory
 *page 269 and after shows the different buffers for messages
 ->if i understand correctly configuration of the ECAN module can be done through registers, but read/write
   buffers are accessible through DMA only
 ->it seems that CAN can be used without DMA (read in the ECAN_DMA doc from microship) even for read/write
   operations
